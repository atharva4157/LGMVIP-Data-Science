# Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Project
Task 2 done in LetsGrowMore Internship
(About project)
### Technologies used:
- - Anaconda- Python 3.8 Distribution, which already has the language’s best and widely used libraries for data science (such as scipy, matplotlib, NumPy and Pandas etc). Anaconda Navigator also comes with Jupyter Notebook, Spyder and VSCode editors etc.
- I used Jupyter notebook
### I learned from this: 
-Trying to predict how the securities exchange will work is one of the most difficult tasks. There are so many variables involved with the expectation – physical elements versus psychological factors, rational and irrational behaviour, and so on.
All of these factors combine to make share costs unpredictable and difficult to predict with any degree of certainty.
Is it possible to use AI to our advantage in this space?AI approaches will potentially reveal examples and insights we hadn’t seen before, and these can be used to make unerringly exact expectations, using features like the most recent declarations of an organization, their quarterly income figures, and so on.
We will work with published information regarding a freely recorded organization’s stock costs in this report.
We’ll use a combination of AI calculations to forecast this company’s future stock price with LSTM.
This project's main purpose is to demonstrate how these calculations are carried out.
- In this model I used the Stacked LSTM(Long Short Term Memory). A Machine Learning Model for Stock Market Prediction. Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on a financial exchange.
