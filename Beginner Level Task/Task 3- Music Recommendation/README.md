# Music Recommendation Project
Task 2 done in LetsGrowMore Internship
(About project)
### Technologies used:
- Anaconda- Python 3.8 Distribution, which already has the language’s best and widely used libraries for data science (such as scipy, matplotlib, NumPy and Pandas etc). Anaconda Navigator also comes with Jupyter Notebook, Spyder and VSCode editors etc.
- I used Jupyter notebook
### I learned from this: 
- Learning objective of doing this project was to first to learn about machine learning and its
key concepts and various data mining techniques and algorithms .other goal was to learn a lot
of machine learning algorithm and how to use them .Just learning algorithms doesn’t makes
you an engineer the real task is to learn which is the right algorithm to apply for a specific
project. 
- The main object in terms of outcome was to create a framework for users which can help
them suggesting the right songs for them .this project aims to find the correlation and
similarity between different music lovers their tastes and various songs so that if a user’s taste
is similar to the other one we can recommend the songs of one to another on the basis of
similar taste. Or if a song is similar to the other we can suggest that song to the user that
listen the first one. One of the object of this project is to reduce the time that user generally
wastes on looking for the right song
