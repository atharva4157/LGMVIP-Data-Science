# Iris Flower Classification Project
Task 1 done in LetsGrowMore Internship
(About project)
### Technologies used:
- Anaconda- Python 3.8 Distribution, which already has the language’s best and widely used libraries for data science (such as scipy, matplotlib, NumPy and Pandas etc). Anaconda Navigator also comes with Jupyter Notebook, Spyder and VSCode editors etc.
- I used Jupyter notebook
### I learned from this: 
- This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.
- To Train a model to distinguish between different species of the Iris flower based on four measurements (features): sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
